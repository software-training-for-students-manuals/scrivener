                <h2>MAC vs. WINDOWS</h2>
                <p>There are a few differences between the Mac and Windows versions, and while this manual will mostly cover features they both possess, when there is a significant difference the information for each will be provided.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Scrivener is a powerful word processor that also doubles as a project management tool. Focusing both on content creation and project structure, Scrivener provides an interface full of various tools that can be used to manage and organize the content in whatever way the user finds best suited to their creative process.</p>
            <p>Scrivener is available for purchase at literatureandlatte.com, with a discount for students and educators, but can also be downloaded for a free 30 day trial. There is both a Windows version and a Mac version, as well as a beta version for Linux. Scrivener has built-in templates for screenplays, fiction, and non-fiction manuscripts. The software also comes with an interactive tutorial, and there are further tutorials on the Scrivener website.</p>
            <h2> About this Class</h2>
            <p>This class will cover the basics of Scrivener, focusing on content organization and the primary tools for keeping a writing project well structured and manageable. By the end of this class, you will have worked with the interface of Scrivener and other related tools. This includes adding content, files, and compiling everything. </p>
            <h2>Prerequisites </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Basic computer operation skills.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Access to Scrivener on Mac or Windows
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section><section class="topic"><h1>Scrivener Interface</h1>
        <p> This section provides a brief overview of the Scrivener interface and describes its commonly-used components. To open Scrivener, click the icon with black and white S sign in your computer's desktop or taskbar. If you don't find it there, you may have to search your computer's installed applications to find it.</p>
        <h2>New Project Window</h2>
        <p> When you open Scrivener, it will open a window with options for new types of projects. Scrivener has a number of useful templates for different types of writing which you can access from this window, and the interactive tutorial is also accessible through this first window. However, for the purposes of this class, begin by selecting a blank Scrivener project, and name it Lorem Ipsum or Lipsum for short.</p>
        <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/interface-newproject.png"> </div>
        <h2>Common Interface Components</h2>
        <p>Scrivener's interface consists of <b> six</b> main areas for both Mac and Windows as labeled below.</p>
        <p><b>Mac Interface</b></p>
        <div class="centered-image-large"> <img src="images/interface-mac.png"></div>
        <p><b>Windows Interface</b></p>
        <div class="centered-image-large"> <img src="images/interface-windows.png"> </div>
        <p>These main areas in Scrivener are the common navigating areas you will need to organize and manage your writing project. These are individually explained below.</p>
        <p><b>Menu Bar</b></p>
        <p>The menu bar is located at the top of the Scrivener window in Windows and at the top of the computer screen in Mac. It contains navigation to most of the major tools in Scrivener, as well as options for configuring the workspace layout. </p>
        <p><b>Tool Bar</b></p>
        <p>The toolbar is located directly beneath the menu bar on Windows, and is the top of the Scrivener window in Mac. It contains buttons for several of Scrivener’s main features, including the view modes, Binder and Inspector, Composition mode, and Compiling. </p>
        <p><b>Format bar, Header, Footer</b></p>
        <p> The <b>Format bar</b> is located beneath the toolbar, and contains text formatting options such as font selection and text size. The <b>Header</b> is directly below the format bar, and contains the title of the currently selected Scrivener document as well as arrows for navigating through the Scrivener documents. The <b>Footer </b>is at the bottom of the Scrivener window, and contains the word and character count.</p>
        <p><b>Editor</b></p>
        <p>The Editor is the document viewing area, located in the center of the Scrivener window. Along with simply viewing Scrivener documents, it can also be used in a variety of viewing modes to further facilitate project creation.</p>
        <p><b>Inspector</b></p>
        <p>The Inspector is to the right in the Scrivener window. It contains several tools for managing the organization of document content, including project notes, adding comments and footnotes, and managing keywords and Meta-Data. It can be hidden or accessed by clicking the Inspector button in the top right of the toolbar.</p>
        <p><b>Binder</b></p>
        <p>The Binder is located to the left of the Scrivener window, and contains the folder and document organizational system that is integral to Scrivener’s project management capabilities. It can be hidden or accessed by clicking the Binder button in the top left of the toolbar. There are a number of different tools we can use to easily navigate and manuever the binder workspace, which we will look at when we start to create content. The Binder comes with three default folders that have suggested uses, but these are very customizable.</p>
        <div class="side-image-medium"><img src="images/navigate-binder.png" /></div>
        <p> The first folder is the <b>Draft folder</b>, which is intended primarily for generating text and organizing the content of the final product.</p>
        <p>The <b>Research folder</b> is where source material can be added, such as images and pdfs. While both of these folders can be used as desired and even renamed, it is important to note that images and pdfs cannot be added to the Draft folder. </p>
        <p>The <b>Trash folder</b> is for currently unwanted material, and can be emptied. This is the only way to get rid of documents and folders in Scrivener.</p>
        </section><section class="topic"><h1>Adding Content</h1>
        <h2>Creating Folders and Documents </h2>
        <p> Folders and Documents in Scrivener are essentially the same thing. Both can be used as a regular text document, and other documents can be organized in them. Main use of the names ‘Folder’ and ‘Document’ in Scrivener is to help organize the material visually. In light of this, it is common practice to not use a Folder file as a text document, and not to use a text document as a folder, to keep things straightforward. </p>
        <div class="side-image-large"><img src="images/content-add-1.png" /></div>
        <p>There are two main ways to create a new Document or Folder</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Click the green plus sign button on the toolbar. Click on the arrow next to this large green plus button and choose <span class="type-text">New Text</span> for a document file or <span class="type-text">New Folder</span> for a new folder in the binder.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click on the buttons in the left most bottom corner of the Scrivener window.</p>
                <div class="side-image-large"><img src="images/content-add-2.png" /></div>
                <p>The first button has <b>sheet sign with a plus</b> and will create a new document. The second button has a <b>folder sign with a plus</b> and creates a folder. The third <b>settings </b>button will open a new window with many more options. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Exercise: Creating Folder Outline and Adding Documents</h3>
        <div class="side-image-medium"> <img src="images/content-outline.png" /></div>
        <p>Create the following outline in the binder</p>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p>Add the folders in the Drafts folder using the steps listed above. For this exercise make the folders as shown in the image.</p>
                <ol class="instruction-list">
                    <li>
                        <p>To move the folder, click and drag the folder into the folder as needed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>To change a folder into a document (file), right click and change it to file and vice versa.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Add one or two documents to each folder except folders Styles and Genres. Add some Lorem Ipsum text to each from <span class="type-text">lipsum.txt</span> file.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Importing Content </h2>
        <p> Scrivener allows the users to create and use a network of text-based cross-references within their project. </p>
        <h3>Exercise: Importing a PDF </h3>
        <p>Importing PDFs is very easy, but they can only be placed into the Research folder in the Binder.</p>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p> Click on the Research folder in the Binder.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> In the menu bar navigate to <span class="type-text">File > Import > Files.</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Select the file <span class="type-text">Classical Lorem Ipsum.pdf.</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Click on Import.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Exercise: Importing a Word Document</h3>
        <p>Because the word document we are using has many sections, we want to preserve that structure in Scrivener. To do this, we will need to Import and Split the word document. This requires some preparation of the Word document.</p>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p> Open <span class="type-text">loremipsum.docx</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Insert an octothorpe (otherwise known as a hashtag or pound symbol: <b>#</b>) between each section.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Save As <span class="type-text">loremipsum1.docx</span>, so the original file remains unchanged. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> In Scrivener, click on the Styles and Genres folder.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> In the menu bar, navigate to <span class="type-text"> File > Import > Import and Split. </span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select <span class="type-text">loremipsum1.docx</span> and ensure that the octothorpe is chosen as the section separator. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Choose Import from the window.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Exercise: Importing Images</h3>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p>In the menu bar, navigate to <span class="type-text">File > Import > Files.</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>From the pop up window, select the file <span class="type-text">Lorem Impsum Cloud.png</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Click on Import.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        </section><section class="topic"><h1> View Modes </h1>
        <p>Scrivener features <b> three main ways </b>to arrange the information and content through a few different viewing modes, each of which has its own organizational layout. These are called view modes and are located in the toolbar. All of the view modes change the <b>layout of the Editor panel</b> of the Scrivener interface, and can be used with the Binder and Inspector. In addition to these view modes, Scrivener also offers a few other ways to arrange the workspace, which makes the interface very versatile.</p>
        <h2> Document view </h2>
        <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/view-modes.png"></div>
        <p>The Document view mode is best suited for content creation in Scrivener. This mode simply provides <b>space to write</b>, but also has two ways of viewing the content. These are called <b>Single Document</b> and <b>Group Mode</b> depending on if you are viewing a single document or a folder.</p>
        <p><b>Single Document View</b></p>
        <div class="side-image-large"> <img src="images/view-singledocument.png"></div>
        <p> If you click on a single document in the binder, only that document will be shown in the Editor. On the view panel, the icon for the Document View mode will show a single page.</p>
        <div class="side-image-large"> <img src="images/view-groupmode.png"></div>
        <p><b>Group Mode Document View</b></p>
        <p> If you click on a folder, you can view all the subdocuments in that folder as one long document with <b>dashed lines</b> dividing these subdocuments. The icon for the Document View mode will change into multiple pages.</p>
        <h2> Corkboard View </h2>
        <div class="side-image-large"> <img src="images/view-corkboard.png"></div>
        <p>The Corkboard view mode is most useful when in <b>group mode</b> or <b> looking into a folder</b> from the Binder. It provides a notecard styled look at the outline of the project.</p>
        <p>In the corkboard mode, synopsis and some other data added in the inspector can be viewed, allowing a look at the structure of the project. A folder can also have a notecard and synopsis, which can be useful if there are many folders within folders in the project. The size and spacing of the notecards can be adjusted to your preference using the <b> Corkboard preferences </b> button at the far right of the Footer view, which opens a menu with formatting options.</p>
        <div class="centered-image-medium"><img src="images/view-corkboardoptions.png"></div>
        <h2> Outline View </h2>
        <div class="side-image-large"> <img src="images/view-outline.png"></div>
        <p> The Outline view mode is similar to the corkboard, but is presented as a <b> list </b>of the folders, documents, and subdocuments.</p>
        <p> There are more options for viewing document statistics such as the date created, keywords, and word count, as well as any custom Meta-Data you created. These can be viewed under the <b> arrow </b>to the top right of the editor when in Outline view. Similarly to the Corkboard, the Outline is best used in ‘group mode’. </p>
        <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/view-outlineoptions.png"></div>
        <div class="sidebar-note">
            <h2>MAC vs. WINDOWS</h2>
            <p>Split view can occur horizontally or vertically in both Mac and Windows. </p>
            <p>In Mac this can be navigated to from the <b>menu bar</b>, by choosing <span class="type-text"> View > Layout > Split Horizontally or Split Vertically.</span> </p>
            <p>In Windows split view can be accessed by the button in the top right corner of the <b>Editor Window. </b></p>
        </div>
        <h2> Split View </h2>
        <p>The Editor panel also provides another way of viewing documents or view modes in the Editor panel. Scrivener features the split view, which splits the Editor panel into two panels, each of which works separately. This split view enables the user to view two different documents at once, or even view the corkboard in one panel and a document in the other.</p>
        <p><b>Horizontal Split</b></p>
        <p> In the horizontal split, two panels are on top of each other. These two panels can display two different files or two different view modes. </p>
        <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/view-splithorizontal.png" /></div>
        <p><b>Vertical Split</b></p>
        <p>In the vertical split, two panels are side by side. You may utilize different views as works best for your needs.</p>
        <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/view-splitvertical.png" /></div>
        <h2> Compose/ Full Screen View </h2>
        <p> Scrivener has a sophisticated full screen mode that works somewhat differently from simply filling the screen with the Scrivener window.</p>
        <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/view-compose.png"></div>
        <p>If you check out Preferences/Options, there will be even more customization features for Compose/Full Screen mode.</p>
        <p>To reach Compose/Full Screen mode, click on the <b> double arrow button </b> in the toolbar. </p>
        <p> Instead of making the Scrivener window fit the size of your screen, the full screen mode takes you into a completely different interface called <b> Compose</b> on Mac and <b> Full Screen </b>on Windows. This setup is designed to help you block out the rest of your computer and focus on the essentials of writing. You can fade the background as you see fit, and change the size and placement of your paper. </p>
        <div class="full-width-image"> <img src="images/view-composeoptions.png"></div>
        </section><section class="topic"><h1>The Inspector </h1>
        <p> The Inspector panel is on the right-hand side of the screen and provides a convenient space for users to create and store more information associated with the documents. There are six tabs in the Inspector, each serving a specific purpose to help you add and search meta-data in different forms. </p>
        <h2> Synopsis </h2>
        <div class="side-image-large"> <img src="images/inspector-synopsis.png"></div>
        <p>Each folder and document in Scrivener except the three default folders can have a synopsis added to it. This is useful for organization and also becomes important when using various different view modes. The synopsis editing area is located at the top of the Inspector window, and can either have pertinent information written on it, or be an an image. In the top right corner of the Synopsis section, there is a <b> double arrow icon </b>that opens a drop down list from which you can select either the <b> notecard style </b> or the <b>image</b>. To add an image instead of writing text, simply drag and drop the image file into the synopsis section. </p>
        <h2> General Meta-Data</h2>
        <div class="side-image-large"> <img src="images/inspector-generalmetadata.png"></div>
        <p>The General section of the Inspector holds organizational information about the document or folder being viewed. There is an option for adding Labels such as ‘concept’ or ‘chapter’ and Statuses like ‘draft’ and ‘done’. Both labels and statuses can be edited to include other relevant categories. There is also an option to either see when the document was last modified or was created. A couple of the options in General are related to compiling the final draft, but they can be overridden by the final compiling process so they are not always immediately necessary. However, it is still good practice to <span class="highlight">uncheck ‘Include in Compile’</span> if you do not intend the document to be in the final draft.</p>
        <h2> The Six Inspector Tabs</h2>
        <p>Inspector has six tabs that serve different purposes for the project. This image below displays the tabs, each of which is explained below. </p>
        <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/inspector-tabs.png"></div>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <div class="side-image-large"> <img src="images/inspector-notes.png"></div>
        <p>In the Inspector tab area, Notes is the first tab. In essence, the Notes area simply provides a place to write text relevant to the document without being part of the document itself. Because of this, notes are especially useful for recording any pertinent information that is not necessarily going to show up in the finished document, like an outline or to-do list. There are two different types of notes, <b> Document Notes </b>and <b>Project Notes </b>. Switching between the two can be done through the drop-down under the double arrows at the top of the Notes area. </p>
        <p><b>Document Notes </b> pertain only to the individual document that is currently being viewed, but <b>Project Notes </b> can be accessed while viewing any document, so more general information can be kept in them.</p>
        <div class="sidebyside-image-large"> <img src="images/inspector-documentnotes.png"> <img src="images/inspector-projectnotes.png"> </div>
        <h2> References</h2>
        <p>For academic writing, Scrivener offers a useful tool to store pdfs, images and any other documents that are not part of writing but should be easily accessible to the writer. References tab is contained in the second tab of the Inspector.</p>
        <div class="centered-image-small"> <img src="images/inspector-references.png"></div>
        <p>Like the notes, there are <b>Document references</b> and <b>Project references</b>. For the most part, these references are simply to link to other related documents, both in the Scrivener file and elsewhere on your computer. <span class="highlight"> <b>It is not a citation manager </b></span>, but it can be used to keep track of references and make it easier to access them while also viewing the current document. If you double click on the references, Scrivener will open internal links in split view mode and external links in a separate window.</p>
        <div class="side-image-large"><img src="images/inspector-addreference.png"></div>
        <h3>Exercise: Adding an Internal Reference </h3>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>

            <li>
                <p> Click the plus sign drop down at the top right of the References section. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Choose <span class="type-text"> Look up and Add External Reference.</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> From the new window, browse to the external document you want to link with the document or folder.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2> Keywords</h2>
        <p> Keywords are an immensely useful part of Scrivener, located in the third tab of the Inspector. </p>
        <div class="centered-image-small"> <img src="images/inspector-keywords.png"></div>
        <p>Keywords can be added to documents in order to make them easier to search. For instance, all documents containing references to Pirate Ipsum could be given the keyword ‘Pirate’ and then later, a search could be made for all the documents that had that keyword assigned. Keywords can be assigned by clicking the <b> plus sign </b> at the top of the Keyword tab in the lower section of the Inspector. As Keywords are created, they are added to a long list called <b>Project Keywords</b>, which can be accessed from a drop down in the top right corner of the Keyword area and opens in a new window. Once a keyword is created, it can be added from this area without retyping. </p>
        <h3> Adding and Deleting Keywords</h3>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p> Click the plus button in the top of the Keywords section. </p>
                <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/inspector-addkeyword.png"></div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Type 'lipsum' into the blank field. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Repeat three or four times with different keywords. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Navigate to the Binder and open a different document. </p>
            </li>
            <div class="side-image-large"> <img src="images/inspector-projectkeywords.png"></div>
            <li>
                <p> Click the <b>settings</b> button in the top right of the Keywords section. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Choose Show Project Keywords. A New Project Keywords window appears on the top.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Drag and drop the keywords from the <b> Project Keywords window </b> into the Document's keywords section.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To delete a keyword, select the keyword and then click the <b>minus </b> sign at the top of the Keywords section tab.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2> Custom Meta-Data</h2>
        <p> Meta-Data is another very useful way to add categories and notes to each document. This is the fourth tab in the Inspector.</p>
        <div class="centered-image-small"> <img src="images/inspector-metadata.png"></div>
        <p>Meta-data can be customized to the document, and help keep track of things that may or may not be covered under the general organization options. This is especially useful for brief notes that are pertinent to the structure, such as keeping track of a timeline in a novel.</p>
        <h3> Creating Meta-Data </h3>
        <div class="side-image-large"><img src="images/inspector-addmetadata.png"></div>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p> Choose Define Meta-Data Fields in the middle of the Meta-Data area of the Inspector.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> To add the Meta-data fields, click the plus button at the bottom of the new window that comes up.</p>
            </li>
            <div class="centered-image-medium"><img src="images/inspector-definemetadata.png"></div>
            <li>
                <p>Name the meta-data and choose the color and features for it. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3> Editing Meta-Data</h3>
        <div class="side-image-large"> <img src="images/inspector-editmetadata-1.png"></div>
        <p> If you need to edit Meta-Data later, after you have created it follow the steps given below.</p>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p> Click the drop down at the top right of the Meta-Data pane.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Choose Edit Custom Meta-Data Settings.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Make the required edits in the Custom Settings window.</p>
                <div class="centered-image-large"> <img src="images/inspector-editmetadata-2.png"></div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p> Notice that you can edit some of the information from the General Meta-data section here, as there are tabs for Labels and Status, which are both menus accessed through the General Meta-data section of the Inspector.</p>
        <h2> Snapshots</h2>
        <p>Snapshots are an extremely useful feature in Scrivener that lets you save versions of your document for future reference and comparison. The Snapshot feature is the fifth tab in the Inspector. </p>
        <div class="centered-image-small"> <img src="images/inspector-snapshots.png"></div>
        <p> When clicked, Snapshot tab splits the Inspector window into two sections. The <span class="highlight"> top section</span> contains the list of snapshots you’ve taken of the selected document, and the <span class="highlight"> bottom section</span> is where the snapshots are viewed. </p>
        <h3> Creating Snapshots</h3>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p>Select a document for which you want to save a snapshot.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Choose the Snapshot tab from the Inspector panel.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click plus sign in the top right of the Snapshots tab. The snapshot details will appear in the top section and you can view the snapshot in the bottom section.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can rename the Snapshot, if necessary in the top section.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/inspector-createsnapshot.png"></div>
        <h3>Reverting the Snapshot</h3>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p> Select the Snapshot you want to revert the document to. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click the Roll Back button right below the Snapshots tab. </p>

            <li>
                <p> Scrivener will ask you if you want to take a snapshot of the current version before reverting to the other snapshot. Click Yes if you have not already created a snapshot of the current version.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Deleting the Snapshot</h3>
        <ol class="instruction-list">

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Scrivener will ask you if you want to delete the selected snapshot. If you are sure, click OK.</p>
                <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/inspector-deletesnapshot.png"></div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2> Comments and Footnotes</h2>
        <p>Comments and Footnotes, the final (sixth) tab in the Inspector, is used for organizing comments and footnotes for your documents, which can then be easily compiled with the document and transferred into Word as comments and footnotes. They can also be used as space for adding more specific text notes to yourself about the project.</p>
        <div class="centered-image-small"> <img src="images/inspector-comments.png"></div>
        <h3> Creating and Deleting Footnotes and Comments </h3>

        </ol>
        </section><section class="topic"><h1>Misc.</h1>
        <h2> Collections </h2>
        <p>The Collections feature is used to <b> group together documents </b> that are separate from their location in the actual project. One use of this feature would be to group all documents that refer to a certain common topic, so they can be located quickly regardless of where the documents appear in the actual project structure.</p>
        <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/collections-panel.png"></div>

        <h2> Overview of Preferences/Options</h2>
        <p>The preferences in Scrivener are extensive, and very suited to tailoring the Scrivener experience to your own preference. Scrivener comes with some pre-set preferences, so if Scrivener is doing something that you don’t like (perhaps doing some automatic capitalization and spell-checking), you can check out preferences and see if you can change it.</p>
        <div class="sidebar-note">
            <h2> MAC Vs WINDOWS </h2>
            <p> The location for Preferences is in the <b>menu bar</b> but it is different in Mac and Windows. In Mac, Preferences is located under <span class="type-text">  Scrivener </span> in the menu bar. In Windows, this is located under <span class="type-text"> Tools > Options </span> in the menu bar.</p>
        </div>
        <p> To open the dialog box for preference, in the menu bar choose <span class="type-text"> Tools > Options</span>. The preferences window has several options for most of the main features of Scrivener. For example, you can specify how often you want Scrivener to automatically save, change all the fonts, customize colors, even set options for spell-checking, and make sure that your projects are being backed up on your computer. </p>
        <p><b>Preferences in Mac</b></p>
        <div class="centered-image-large"> <img src="images/preferences-mac.png"></div>
        <p><b>Preferences in Windows</b></p>
        <div class="centered-image-large"> <img src="images/preferences-windows.png"></div>
        <p>Not everything in preferences is going to be applicable to everyone, so this is a feature that you should explore and find out what works for you. For example, if you don’t use the corkboard, then the corkboard preferences are not going to be very important for your Scrivener use.</p>
        <h2>Project Targets and Icons </h2>
        <p>Scrivener has many small tools and tricks for organization and working on projects. Two of the most useful of these are the <b> Project Targets </b>and the ability to assign <b> Icons </b> to documents and folders in the Binder. </p>
        <h2>Project Targets</h2>
        <p>If you are working on a project with specific word count or page specifications, project targets is the tool for you. Project Targets are used for word or page count or just to set goals for your work in general.</p>
        <div class="side-image-medium"> <img src="images/project-target.png"></div>
        <h3> Adding Project Targets</h3>
        <p>To add a target goal for the overall project, go to menu bar and choose <span class="type-text"> Project Targets</span>. Then edit the draft target accordingly. Note that the Draft target only counts documents in the Draft folder in its assessment of the project. </p>
        <h3>Adding Document Goal</h3>
        <p>If you want to add a goal for a single document, you can click the tiny <b> target tool </b> in the bottom right of the footer view on a document and add a word count goal. However, <span class="highlight"> you cannot add a page count goal for a single document. </span> </p>
        <div class="sidebyside-image-small"> <img src="images/document-target-windows.png"> <img src="images/document-target-mac.png"></div>
        <h2>Icons</h2>
        <p>If you like to color code things, adding Icons to document and folders in the Binder is a good option for you. The Icons are accessible by <b> right-clicking </b> on a document or folder <span class="highlight"> in the Binder</span>, navigating to <span class=type-text> Change Icon </span> from the pop-up window and choosing an Icon from the list that appears.</p>
        <h2>Tables</h2>
        <div class="side-image-medium"> <img src="images/table-properties.png"></div>
        <p>Scrivener offers simple tables to include in the documents. If you need to use tables, simple formatting with borders and cell colors is available. </p>
        <h3> Creating a Table in Scrivener</h3>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p>From the menu bar, choose <span class="type-text"> Format > Table > Insert Table</span>. A simple table of 2 rows and 2 columns will appear in the document.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To add more rows, columns, or to change the properties of this table, navigate to <span class="type-text"> Table > Table Properties </span> in the menu bar.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Edit the table properties by using the window that appears.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2> Scratch Pad</h2>
        <div class="sidebar-note">
            <h2> MAC Vs WINDOWS </h2>
            <p>The location for Scratch Pad is little different in Mac and Windows. In Mac, Scratch Pad is located in <span class="type-text">  Window > Show Scratch Pad </span> in the menu bar. In Windows, this is located under <span class="type-text"> Tools> Scratch Pad </span> in the menu bar.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The Scratch Pad in Scrivener is an immensely useful feature, being an excellent tool for both researching or just make notes. Essentially, Scratch Pad is a separate window you can use to collect information that you can then send to one of your Scrivener projects. It can be open even when your Scrivener file is minimized, which makes it very convenient to use. Scratch Pad is unaffiliated with any particular Scrivener file and you can send information from it to any project that you have open.</p>
        <h3> Using Scratch Pad to Create Notes</h3>
        <p>Once you are able to navigate and open the Scratch Pad window from the menu bar, a Scratch Pad window will pop up. You can click on the plus button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch Pad window. </p>
        <div class="centered-image-large"> <img src="images/scratchpad-notes.png"></div>
        <h3> Sending Notes to Project</h3>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p> If you want to add a selection of text from the Notes, make your selection first, otherwise go straight to the next step. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the bottom row of Scratch Pad window, choose <span class="type-text"> Send to Project </span> OR <span class="type-text"> Send to Scrivener. </span> </p>
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Alternatively you can choose <span class="type-text"> Copy Document To </span> and pick any folder you would like. Or you can add text from Scratch Pad notes <span class="highlight"> to a document </span> instead by choosing <span class="type-text"> Append Text To </span> instead. </p>

        <h2>About Managing Citations</h2>
        <p>Scrivener is a very powerful organization tool, but the one drawback for use in academic writing is a lack of good tools for managing citations. Scrivener <b>does not</b> have any internal citation management, like Word does, and it also does not work very cohesively with independent citation manager software, moreover, you will likely end up polishing the formatting in Word or another word processor that has more formatting options for citations and references, regardless of how you keep things together in Scrivener.</p>
        <p>That being said, it’s certainly not impossible. There are a number of great ways to deal with citations and references in Scrivener. The easiest way to find a method that suits you is to head to a search engine and look there for options. Because Scrivener has this blind spot, many people who use it have written guides and tutorials for how to deal with citations, and you can even find tutorials or guides that are tailored towards the use of a specific citation manager, like Zotero or EndNote. Just keep in mind that <span class="highlight"> Scrivener is built to facilitate writing, not extensive formatting.</span></p>
        </section><section class="topic"><h1>Compiling</h1>
        <p>The compiling options in Scrivener are fairly extensive, more so in Mac than Windows. Compile tool can be found on the left side of the tool bar.</p>
        <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/compile-button.png"></div>
        <div class="sidebar-note">
            <h2>MAC Vs WINDOWS</h2>
            <p>The Compiling window that opens after clicking the button on toolbar is a little different in Mac and Windows. Mac compiling window has two tabs, one is <b> Summary </b>and one is <b>All Options</b>. Summary contains some basic compiling options, but All Options is the more in-depth tab. Windows does not have the Summary tab.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Compile option is the most used feature of Scrivener. You can prepare your document for printing or exporting to another word processor, or even compile your document for publishing in a variety of different formats, including Kindle. Your use of the Scrivener compiling options is very dependent on your project needs.</p>
        <p>This section explains includes an exercise that uses two of the most useful options for basic compilation: choosing which documents to export, and formatting the footnotes.</p>
        <p>For more extensive information on the various Compiling options, see the <b>Appendix</b>. Compiling in both Mac and Windows is done in a separate window you can access from the Compile button in the <span class="type-text"> toolbar.</span></p>

        <p> Congratulations on finishing the Scrivener course! Scrivener is an incredibly powerful writing tool that offers myriads of organizational options for your projects, and can be used in many innovative ways. If you’re looking for more ideas for working with the many features it offers, there is an energetic Scrivener community that has created many blog posts and tutorials for a variety of different configurations of the tools and resources available in Scrivener. Happy writing!</p>
        </section><section class="topic"><h1>Appendix: Compiling Options
        for Printing, Microsoft Word, and
        Rich Text Format</h1>
        <p> Scrivener offers many different compiling options for a variety of different exporting purposes, such as preparing a document for different types of Ebooks, PDFs, Rich Text Format, and Word Documents, just to name a few. The options you have for compiling change from format to format. Some options are exclusive to certain exporting choices, or exclusive to the Mac version of Scrivener.</p>
        <p> Chances are, you’re working with something that you either need to print or export to a word processor for final formatting. These are very common exporting options, and many people prefer to export their Scrivener work to Microsoft Word or another word processor before finishing and printing. This appendix will describe the compiling options for these two exporting formats in more detail. </p>
        <p> If you are compiling on Windows for Print, Microsoft Word (both .doc and .docx), or another word processor (in which case you would use Rich Text Format), all of your options are the same for each. If you are compiling on Mac, there are more options overall, and also a few differences in the options for each format.</p>
        <h2> Options for both Mac and Windows </h2>
        <h3> Contents </h3>
        <p> In Contents, you can choose what of your Scrivener file you are compiling. If you have created an extensive folder organizing system that is not dependent on the default Draft and Research content folders, then you will definitely want to use this to select only the documents or folders you want to compile together. You can also choose whether or not to add a page break before each document you are compiling very easily from this section.</p>
        <h3> Separators </h3>
        <p> This section lets you be more specific about transitions between sections of your document. You can choose to add page breaks, empty lines, a single return, or a customized option between all possible transitions that might occur between folders and text documents. </p>
        <h3> Formatting </h3>
        <p> This section provides you with an preview text editor area so you can see the changes you are applying to your document. Here you can include and format titles for the sections of your document, override any previous text and notes formatting with new choices, and even include your meta-data, notes, and synopsis, and format those as well by using the included text editor.</p>
        <h3> Transformations </h3>
        <p> This section is especially useful for when you are compiling for RTF or plain text, it essentially lets you change certain aspects of your document to be more compatible with other text editors, such as converting em-dashes to double hyphens, italics to underlines or vice versa, or simply converting to plain text. On Windows, there is a section specific for RTF compatibility in this section, where you have a couple of options for formatting highlighting and hyperlinks.</p>
        <h3> Replacements </h3>
        <p> If you need to replace any words or phrases with different ones all at once, this section will take care of it very efficiently. It’s similar to find and replace in Microsoft word, except if you add these replacements in Scrivener, it will save them for this document and replace them every time you compile for any format.</p>
        <h3> Footnotes/Comments</h3>
        <p> You can choose how to export your footnotes here, whether they are formatted as footnotes or converted to endnotes, as well as other formatting details such as font type, indentation, and numbering. If you have comments you would like exported, you can choose how to export them as well.</p>
        <h3> Page Settings </h3>
        <p> This controls the basic layout of the page, from header and footer to margins and fonts. If you have ‘Use project Page Setup settings’ selected, then you will only be able to format the Header and Footer, but if you uncheck it, you can change the margins and orientation. </p>
        <h2> Options for Mac </h2>
        <p> The following are compiling options exclusive to Scrivener for Mac. Because the options sometimes change depending on how you want to export your document, the formats these options are applicable in has been noted.</p>
        <h3> Print Settings </h3>
        <h4> (Print)</h4>
        <p> The print settings are intended for configuring your document to print to a PDF. You have two major options, to have a Publishing style layout, which mainly does not support end-of-page footnotes. You can also use the Proofing layout, which exports with all the same features as RTF or Word. There is more extensive documentation of both of these options in Scrivener, but the main difference is that Publishing is a better option for something like an e-book or self publishing, and Proofing is better for academic writing that requires citations and footnotes.</p>
        <h3> Layout </h3>
        <h4> (Print, RTF, Word) </h4>
        <p> This section lets you make a few choices for text layout, such as using separators to deal with empty lines and whether or not to support hyphenation. </p>
        <h3> Statistics  </h3>
        <h4> (Print, RTF, Word) </h4>
        <p> This lets you choose specifically what sections of your document to include in word or character counts. You can, for instance, leave out your front page matter and footnotes, or conversely, choose to count their word and character count with the overall statistics. </p>
        <h3> Tables </h3>
        <h4> (Print, RTF, Word) </h4>
        <p> The table options are only relevant in certain cases, but the options will let you merge any tables that are only separated by empty lines and blank space if they have the same number of columns.</p>
        <h3> Meta-Data </h3>
        <h4> (RTF, Word) </h4>
        <p> This lets you add or change the meta-data to your project, like Title, Author, Subject, and Copyright. You can add comments as well, and keywords. These are independent of the commenting and keyword functions in the Inspector. </p>
        <h3> RTF Compatibility </h3>
        <h4> (RTF, Word) </h4>
        <p> This set of options is very useful if you are compiling for a word processor that does not support everything that Scrivener does, such as footnotes or tables. You have the option to strip your table formatting, convert your footnotes and comments into regular text, and there is even a specific option for using Microsoft Word compatible indents for bullets and numbered lists. </p>
        <h3> Quick Font Override </h3>
        <h4> (Print, RTF, Word) </h4>
        <p> This lets you override all the font settings you have chosen everywhere else in Scrivener with one font of choice. If you want to change everything to Times New Roman in one fell swoop, this is what you use. </p>
